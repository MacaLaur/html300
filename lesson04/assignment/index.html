    <!-- Explanation of the animation I created as well as a working link to the inspiration source -->
    <p>I found inspiration for my animation at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_flip_card" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>. For my final project, as I will be implementing the Zomato API to help users create food agendas for their travels, I think the flip card animation will be a neat way to display their custom food agenda behind each unique place they visit. The component that I created here shows that the user has created an agenda for their upcoming trip to Los Angeles. As the user hovers over the card, it flips to the backside to show the food agenda that they have built. </p>
